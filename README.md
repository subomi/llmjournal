# llmjournal
llmjournal is a project dedicated to curating stories about how people are using Large Language Models (LLMs) in their daily lives.

## Motivation
AI and LLMs are the future—there’s no turning back. We are experiencing a profound paradigm shift, and I firmly believe that what AI can do, AI will (eventually) do. Lately, I’ve been deliberately exploring ways to integrate these tools into my workflow to enhance productivity.

This curiosity has led me to actively seek out and collect posts about how others are leveraging LLMs in their work. My goal with llmjournal is to gather these insights in one place, creating a central reference for anyone interested in real-life applications of LLMs. 
These curated blog posts document use cases, essential tools, and workflows shared by individuals delibrating using LLMs at work.
